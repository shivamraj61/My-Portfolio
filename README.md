# About Myself

My name is Shivam Raj, a second-year mechanical engineering student. <br />
I have always been quite drawn to different types and applications of tech.<br />
Presently pursuing my studies from BIT Mesra, I have joined some clubs to learn and explore better. One such club is the GDSC. <br />
This repo is actually my first task after joining the GDSC. It's quite hands-on and I'm looking forward to the higher end tasks in the future.<br />

## My Hobbies

I'm an avid reader and find it quite amusing to see a different world from someone else's perspective. I belive it helps me ponder deeper into my own views and re-establish my opinions. It's like earning experience of an extra lifetime while still spending yours.<br />
My love for tech occupies my free time whenever I could muster the energy and resources to do so. Earlier I tried my hands on electronics, making miniature transformers, speaker-amplifers, robots, etc., but over the years I am more inclined towards the aspect of programming, since in a poetic sense, it gives me command over these creations, which were mostly just copied from other creators before. The desire to create something entirely my own seems to be the driving force.
